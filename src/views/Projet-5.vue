    text_desc="Nowadays, fathers-to-be are not enough involved in the couple during the pregnancy. 
    Our solution? Belly Bump. Our product has been created for couple who are expecting a baby. By proposing this mobile application, 
    we resolve problems such as the lack of the fatherâ€™s involvement, the oversight of important meetings and fears about the pregnancy. 
    It meets with needs like being well-organized during pregnancy and having access to information about work and pregnancy, meals, fears, and other topics. 
    Thereupon, this application makes easier the communication within the couple because each can have access to the personal data of the other. 
    Thanks to the articles of the app, the couple can interact with each other through new topics."
